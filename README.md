#Motorlab Scheduler
by Emerson Fang

##Description
As a starting point, this will be a basic event-scheduler.  The app will enable the user to create events (single or multiple days), and contact people with an 
e-mail that lists all the restrictions and requirements of the schedule.  People will select times that work for them, and then the app will use this information to send optimal times to the user 
for each invitee.  At this stage, the user can select what works best, then send another e-mail out to invitees to confirm.  User will receive confirmation of 
the appointment, and both user and invitee will receive a link to a .ics to enter the event into their calendar.  The next step of the app might be to update 
a database of the users to say that they have been either contacted, scheduled, or attended the event.
